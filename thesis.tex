\title{Ordered Geometry in Hilbert's \emph{Foundations}}
\author{Phil Scott}

%\abstract{The \emph{Foundations of Geometry} was the first systematic attempt to fill the logical gaps of Euclid's \emph{Elements}. Now with the aid of an interactive theorem prover, we can definitively conclude that story by mechanising Hilbert's axiomatics and their elementary consequences. Keeping as faithful to Hilbert's prose as possible, we use a readable mechanisation language that allows us to go beneath the proofs and reveal the deeper logical structure behind them. Where this structure is not illuminating, we develop new automated tools, tailored to Hilbert's axiomatics, so that the structure can be integrated \emph{implicitly} into a readable proof script. In achieving this, we shall describe a new language for proof automation.}

%\abstract{The \emph{Foundations of Geometry} was the first systematic attempt to fill the logical gaps of Euclid's \emph{Elements}. With the aid of a theorem prover, we take several significant steps towards concluding this story by formalising the first two groups of Hilbert's axiomatics and their elementary consequences. We endeavour to stay faithful to Hilbert's prose and use a readable declarative language in the aims of producing a critical appraisal of Hilbert's original text. We develop automation in terms of general-purpose search combinators which we then tailor to Hilbert's axiomatics. These allow us to recover implicit details that are not illuminating and to explore the proof space independently of the user. Our thesis ends by describing a verified proof of the Jordan Curve Theorem for Polygons from very weak axioms.}

\abstract{In this thesis, we initiate a formal analysis of David Hilbert's axiomatisation of ordered geometry as it appears in the tenth and current edition of his celebrated \emph{Foundations of Geometry}. Using Hilbert as a case-study, we argue that with the help of an interactive proof assistant, we are able to critically analyse the structure of mathematical arguments with an unprecedented level of confidence, provided we stay faithful to the text itself. We use a readable declarative language to support this, verify proofs synthetically as much as possible, and embed automation to recover the computational detail that a mathematician would find tedious. The thesis ends in a large case study, verifying a proof of the Polygonal Jordan Curve Theorem in the very general setting of \emph{ordered geometry}.}
