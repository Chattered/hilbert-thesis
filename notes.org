** TODO Move anything which you reference out of the appendix and into the main chapter. Make upper case all use of word "theorem" which refers to something Hilbert stated.
** TODO Generally need back references to contributions
** TODO Deal with ambiguity: Theorems Hilbert stated; Formalised theorems; Theorem in theorem environment. Maybe use "proposition", and give theorems names, and explain disambiguation.
** TODO Introduction
*** TODO In introduction, be more positive about investigation as a contribution
**** New proof discovered
**** New proofs identified and made rigorous
*** TODO General discussion about dealing with mathematical prose in a faithful way + lessons learned
** TODO Background
*** TODO Comparison between Mizar Light and Isar (System description?)
**** Not sure about this. I don't mention Isabelle much in the background, and it's not the only declarative language out there, or even the only one for HOL~Light.
*** DONE Explain format of formalised proof
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 14:05]
*** DONE Change "System Description" to "Background"
    CLOSED: [2013-01-29 Tue 19:18]
*** DONE Emphasise that Mizar Light is new extension in Declarative Interactivity
    CLOSED: [2013-01-29 Tue 19:28]
*** TODO Distinguish logical metalogic from computational metalogic. Back-reference computational metalogic in ordering chapter
**** Might just try to tone down the use of this term in the ordering chapter.
*** DONE Mention bug in substitution
   CLOSED: [2013-01-29 Tue 19:18]

*** DONE Explain tables for proofs and that right-justified numbers are part of the script
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 14:05]

    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 14:05]
** TODO Axiomatics
*** DONE Forward reference on "erratic"
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 14:40]
*** DONE Remove sentence about "diagrammatic reasoning". Maybe cut down on repitition of "mugs", "tables", "chairs."
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 14:40]
*** DONE Clarify different sorts of difficulty with Tarski.
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 15:00]
*** DONE Clarify "omit the verifications". Everything has been verified, we just don't reproduce *our* verifications
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 15:00]
*** DONE Push "proof" down to start of block
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 15:00]
*** DONE Remove Henderson footnote
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 15:00]
*** DONE Explain that we can use a weaker rendering of g21 in the context of the other axioms and that the stronger has been verified.
    CLOSED: [2013-01-30 Wed 15:00]
*** TODO Use fixfig or something to overrule LaTeX stupidity
*** TODO Cite how Tarski can be generalized
**** It's mentioned in the paper cited. Should I just give a quote?
** TODO Automation
*** DONE Remove thing about "possibly giving Hilbert too much credit."
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 18:39]
*** DONE Other methods: mention Chou + Grobner bases = algebraic, maybe cylindrical algebraic decomposition, turn to synthetic with signed-area + full angle which try to produce readable proofs, but backwards via point-elimination.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:49]
*** DONE Change Related Work to "Background" in Automation, and move "Ranks" out of "Related work" and make it purely incidental: it happens to be similar. But not building on it.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:49]
*** TODO More consistent use of "infer" and "use" in 4.2. Clarify that the first selection of rules are alternative ways to apply existing rules.
*** DONE Mention "typical" list monad.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:49]
*** DONE Clarify eager/lazy and the fact that a stream is just a lazy list, that the stream monad is actually just a variant of a list monad.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:49]
*** TODO Use triple equal for definition
    Maybe just avoid >>= ?
*** DONE Explain when MP can throw an exception and so we need to wrap it.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:50]
*** DONE Give example of ordering conjunctions for quick failure: Pasch axiom. Plane union roles. We put most constrained first.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:50]
*** DONE Delete Lucas Dixon footnote
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:50]
*** DONE Strongly explain what is meant by concurrency, and that it is not parallelisation.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:50]
*** DONE Drop paragraph "parallelisation."
    CLOSED: [2013-02-02 Sat 21:50]
*** TODO Alan: cite for definition of monoid?
**** I'm not sure how to do this.
*** DONE Search is breadth first if you force every generation, but might be depth first if you just map the heads.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 07:26]
**** Explained breadth and depth in more detail.
*** TODO Alan: Specific theorem more generic is question-begging. Not sure why.
** TODO Theorems 3,4,5
*** DONE Explain Veblen's analogous proof with "under the following mapping..."
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 07:26]
*** DONE With these Inner and Outer axioms derived,...
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 07:27]
*** TODO Alan: Constructions in Euclidean Geometry
**** Need to ask Alan about this.
** TODO Linear ordering
*** DONE Explain why "finite" appears in definition of "ordering", explain that it's more general than necessary.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 08:21]
*** DONE Change "potentially infinite" to "arbitrarily large": just clarify
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 08:22]
*** DONE Explain where "ind" comes from.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 08:22]
*** DONE Existence of infinite domains is not a logical axiom in FOL or HOL
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 08:22]
*** TODO Spell out how discover_tac eqs works. Explain that this was all implicit. And why you care. Procedurally = don't care about the details.
**** Might still need more here.
*** DONE Rephrase proof of Theorem~7 as a demo of ORDER_TAC, that it is using the recursive definition of finite, and that it is there redundant, and using the existing recursive definition of infinite. Stay positive.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 08:37]
**** Indirection is necessary in proof of Theorem~7, since INFINITE is a negative property.
*** DONE Conclusion: Separate conflated issues in first paragraph.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 08:37]
*** Jacques: Wants a reference to iota being weaker than epsilon. Might be able to dig up a reference to that guy's talk on why we should all be avoiding epsilon when we can?
** TODO Half planes
*** DONE Total equivalence relation on pairs of arrows. Introduce type of arrow more formally.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 13:29]
*** DONE The correctness of this definition is not necessarily immediately obvious, but it will be clear from the derived theorems. Weaken "will be determined", to "have some evidence."
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 13:29]
*** DONE In either...or stuff, say that this is "positing" and "conjecturing", but that the edits are real.
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 13:29]
*** DONE Hilbert's presentation gets substantially weaker...
    CLOSED: [2013-02-03 Sun 13:29]
*** Change on_half_plane to half_plane_on to reflect reversing arguments.
** TODO Jordan
*** Not to be confused with E. H. Moore.
*** ...So we cannot ray-cast in the direction of a parallel line
*** More than aesthetic reasons: interesting proofs, it explains our initial strategy, and we will be referring back to it, and ideas in this proof became incorporated into the main verification.
*** 8.4.1: Explain that theorem is only easy now with hindsight.
*** Delete paragraph about skipping or strengthen hindsights.
*** A diagram for IH4. Mention we use contraposition of IH5.
*** Ambiguous between inductive hypothesis and proof of step case of inductive hypothesis. Use dashes for step cases.
*** /Give/ contraposition of IH5
*** Change path_connected to rel_path_connected
*** Conclude chapter 9
